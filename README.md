# ipv6-hosts-CERNET
## WHAT
Based on the script of [lennylxx](https://github.com/lennylxx)'s repo [ipv6-hosts](https://github.com/lennylxx/ipv6-hosts), author replaces DNS server to acruire valid IPv6 address of website like Google for CERNET users.

By using this hosts file, users of CERNET with IPv6 access should be able to access websites that are blocked in China (please do limit your use to personal research only), with the benefit of [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) and so on.
## HOW
Hosts file is provided both in this repo and my [fork repo](https://github.com/SiuKam/ipv6-hosts).

Use it as a regular hosts file.

Recommended to use [SwitchHosts!](https://github.com/oldj/SwitchHosts) to manage your hosts files and keep your hosts up-to-date.
